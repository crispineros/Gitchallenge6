ENDAVA MENU!

Suppose that Endava will open a restaurant in Bogota, your team  will have the responsability to create the menu, Endava is requesting for each member of the team a recipe describing the process to prepare your favourite dish and also how that dish will be presented in the menu. 

There are 3 differents roles: 

Kitchen Manager: this person is responsible to verify and modify all recipes (when all recipes already to be in the repo)
Assistant Manager:  this person is responsible to verify and modify all the prices (when all dishes already to be in the menu)
Host: this person is responsible to modify the menu to make more fun to read (not modify dishes or prices) when everithing is done, and the other two roles finished their jobs. 

The deliverables only will be:	
  * A file with the menu	
  * A file for each recipe

You should follow the next conditions:

Use natural language (text files)
Create a new project in the repository (one repository for team)
Use master, dev and branches hierarchy
Use .gitignore if it's needed
Use the appropriate description for each commit done
Should have commits from every member in the team
Interactive rebase is a must at final of the process

Remember:

The main goal of this challenge is to learn GIT, not create very taste dishes (also creativity always is a plus).
Try to use the most of the commands learnt in the presentation.
If you have any question donâ€™t forget to surface into official Git web site https://git-scm.com/ or others sources, ask for help to the speakers, your mentor or any person in Endava, we are able to help you.
Work as a team is the key in this challenge.
The estimated time for this challenge is 4 hours. 

Questions:

Could you described the second commit done in the repository in order to know:
  * Commit ID
  * Author
  * Date
  * Message
What tool or command did you use to know before information?
How do you be able to know the changes done to a file?
Have you used merge or rebase? Why have you chosen it?
What commands did you use through all the challenge? Why did you use them?
 
At the end of the challenge:

The project should be merged in dev branch.
You will have 15 minutes to expose your solution, just take a few minutes to show the result of your work, focus in the GIT aspects: lessons learnt, useful commands found, problems and solutions found. (This session will be schedule for tomorrow morning, if not, ask for it to your mentor lead)
